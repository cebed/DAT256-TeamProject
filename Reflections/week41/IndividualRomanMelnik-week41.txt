- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to implement location tracking, either with Google Maps or some other map service. I have seen another team's app, they use location in their features. Location tracking offers so many possibilities.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By reviewing their code in a group session, I can and do give feedback if I see something that can be improved.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s application of Scrum?
I participated in a stand-up meeting and a group programming session.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I finally added a feature: a total score counter.
