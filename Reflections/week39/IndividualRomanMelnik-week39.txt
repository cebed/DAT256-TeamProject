- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to create and position 'view windows' in Android Studio. Also how to save/load using SharedPreferences.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
When I work on my tasks, I usually learn something. When the team meets in school, I try to share my knowledge with them, if I think it may be useful for them.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s application of Scrum?
I participated in a stand-up meeting, and I'm working on a task.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We have not yet divided the tasks between the team members, so this week I have not been very productive, mostly learning Android Studio.
